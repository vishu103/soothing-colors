#### 1000 App Pledge

The 1000 App Pledge is a challenge I have set out for me to create 1000 apps. I'm doing this to help build my portfolio and improve my development skills. The apps I will develop will range from very simple to very complex and useful.

This the first app I developed under this pledge.

# Soothing Colors
This is a simple color palette generator for Android. Use it to generate beautiful colors and easily copy their HEX values.
**Minimum SDK Version:** 19
